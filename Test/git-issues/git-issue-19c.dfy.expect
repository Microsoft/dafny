git-issue-19c.dfy(41,10): Error: a set comprehension involved in a function definition is not allowed to depend on the set of allocated references, but values of 'basic' may contain references (see documentation for 'older' parameters)
git-issue-19c.dfy(86,12): Error: a function is allowed to be listed in a reads clause only if the function's arguments do not involve any reference types, because then the resulting reads set would depend on the set of allocated references; here, the type 'Basic' violates this rule (see documentation for 'older' parameters)
git-issue-19c.dfy(93,12): Error: a function is allowed to be listed in a reads clause only if the function's arguments do not involve any reference types, because then the resulting reads set would depend on the set of allocated references; here, the type 'X' violates this rule (perhaps declare type 'X' with '(!new)') (see documentation for 'older' parameters)
