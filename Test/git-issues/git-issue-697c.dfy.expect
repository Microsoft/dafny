git-issue-697c.dfy(18,11): Error: Could not prove that the range constrains the bound variable 'c' to be of type EvenCell, and since EvenCell is a ghost subset type, no runtime type filter can be added on the collection whose elements have the type Cell.
git-issue-697c.dfy(9,26): [Related location] EvenCell is ghost because a call to a ghost function is allowed only in specification contexts (consider declaring the function with 'function method')
