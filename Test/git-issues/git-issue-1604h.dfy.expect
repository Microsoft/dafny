git-issue-1604h.dfy(7,35): Error: Could not prove that the bound variable 'j' satisfies the (non runtime testable) type GhostNat after the range, where it's assumed to be of type int based on inferred bounds.
git-issue-1604h.dfy(5,31): [Related location] The constraint of GhostNat cannot be tested at run-time because ghost fields are allowed only in specification contexts
git-issue-1604h.dfy(14,63): Error: value does not satisfy the subset constraints of 'GhostNat'
