title: How-to and FAQ Guide for Dafny users
---

This page is the table of contents for a compendium of mini-lessons on Dafny programming idioms, how to accomplish various programming tasks in Dafny, how to fix error messages,
answers to FAQs or even just occasionally asked questions, and even information that you may not have asked yet, but you might.

These pages are not intended to be a reference manual or an organized tutorial for Dafny.

If you have questions that are not addressed here, be sure to post them on the [Dafny Issues](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/issues) or engage in any of the [discussion sites](../toc#discussion).

This is just a placeholder for now, but we are working on this material.
