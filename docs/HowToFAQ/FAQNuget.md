## Question

Any plans to release the language server as a NuGet package? Seems like it’s not part of the Dafny release.

## Answer

Some material is on nuget ([https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=dafny](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=dafny)):
- The dafny tool
- The Dafny pipeline as a library
- But not yet the Dafny language server
