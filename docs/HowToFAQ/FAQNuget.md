## Question

Any plans to release the language server as a NuGet package? Seems like it’s not part of the Dafny release.

## Answer

It is now.
Some material is on nuget ([https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=dafny](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=dafny)):
- The dafny tool
- The Dafny pipeline as a library
- The Dafny language server
- The Dafny report generator
