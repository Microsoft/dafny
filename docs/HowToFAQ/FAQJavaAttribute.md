## Question

What do attributes {:java "java", "lang"} mean? Where are attributes documented?
```dafny
{% include_relative FAQJavaAttribute.dfy %}
```

## Answer

In general, attributes are documented in a chapter of the [reference manual](https://dafny.org/dafny/DafnyRef/DafnyRef#(sec-attributes); some are also documented in the sections in which the language feature for which they are relevant is described.
However, at present not all of them are documented.

As for `{;java}`, TODO
