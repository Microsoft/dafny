Enable finer options for deciding what to verify. Users can now choose to verify: only root set files; also files reached through include directives, or everything including files from libraries and .doo files. Note that the default for the new CLI has changed, so files reachable through include directives are now verified by default as well.

To prevent users from accidentally using unverified library files, `--verify-scope=RootSourcesAndIncludes` now requires any files passed to `--library` to contain a marker that they have been verified previously, such as is present in `.doo` files. `--verify-scope=RootSources` does not have this requirement, since it already allows skipping the verification of files included through directives.

Migration guide: if you were not using `--verify-included-files`, you can get the old behavior using `--verify-scope=RootSources`. If you were using `--verify-included-files` and `--library`, then you have two options, either use `--verify-scope=Everything`, which increases your verification time because it will now also verify the library files, or compile your library files into the recently introduced .doo files before passing them to `--library`.
