Enable finer options for deciding what to verify. Users can now choose to verify: only root set files; also files reached through include directives, or everything including files from libraries and .doo files. Note that the default for the new CLI has changed, so files reachable through include directives are now verified by default as well. Warning: users setting up their continuous integration should verify their Dafny project using a single call to the Dafny CLI, and let Dafny parallelize the verification tasks instead of doing that by calling the Dafny ClI multiple times concurrently. If for some reason you want to verify each file using a single Dafny CLI call, then please use --verify-scope=RootSources to prevent doing the same verification task more than once.
