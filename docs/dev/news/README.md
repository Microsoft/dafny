# Latest Dafny changes

Each file in this folder describes one change in Dafny since the latest release.

Files in this directory are named `<PR number>.<kind>` and each contains release notes for one merged PR.  `kind` is `feat` or `fix`.  No need to include a link to the PR in the file: it will be added automatically.

## Examples
