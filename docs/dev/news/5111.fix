Let verifier understand opaque function overrides, supporting both when the overridden function is opaque and non-opaque. Revealing such a function for one overriding type has the effect of revealing it for all overriding types.

Also, forbid the case where a function is opaque in a parent trait and the function override is not opaque. (Previously, this had caused a crash.)
