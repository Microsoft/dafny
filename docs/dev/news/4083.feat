When using the Dafny CLI, error messages of the form "the included file <filename> contains error(s)" are no longer reported, since the actual errors for these included files are shown as well. When using the Dafny server, errors like these are still shown, since the Dafny server only shows errors for currently opened files. In addition, such errors are now also shown for files that are indirectly included by an opened file.
