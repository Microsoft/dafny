`dafny build` for Java now creates a library or executable jar file.
- If there is a Main method, the jar is an executable jar. So a simple A.dfy can be built as `dafny build -t:java A.dfy`
and then run as `java -jar A.jar`
- If there is no Main entry point, all the generated class files are assembled into a library Jar file that can be used on the
classpath as a java library.
- In both cases, the DafnyRuntime library is included in the generated jar (possibly allow control via an option as to whether to include the runtime library in the library jar)
- The .java and .class artifacts are retained unless --spill-target-code:0, in which case retaining the artifacts is deprecated.
- The jar file is placed in the current directory.

Having a library or executable jar simplifies the user's task in figuring out how to use the built artifacts.
