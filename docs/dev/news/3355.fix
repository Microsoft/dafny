`dafny build` for Java now creates a library or executable jar file.
- If there is a Main method, the jar is an executable jar. So a simple A.dfy can be built as `dafny build -t:java A.dfy`
and then run as `java -jar A.jar`
- If there is no Main entry point, all the generated class files are assembled into a library jar file that can be used on the
classpath as a java library.
- In both cases, the DafnyRuntime library is included in the generated jar.
- With the old CLI, the new .jar file is placed in the output directory, along with the generated files.
- With the new CLI, the new .jar file is placed in the output directory, but the generated files are in a temporary directory.
- With the new CLI, the generated .java and .class artifacts are deleted unless --spill-translation=true.

Having a library or executable jar simplifies the user's task in figuring out how to use the built artifacts.
