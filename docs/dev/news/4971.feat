- Flip the behavior of `--warn-deprecation` and change the name to `--allow-deprecation`, so the default is now false, which is standard for boolean options.
- When using `--allow-deprecation`, deprecated code is shown using tooltips in the IDE, and on the CLI when using `--show-tooltips`.
- Replace the option `--warn-as-error` with the option `--succeed-on-warnings`. The new option, when false, the default value, causes Dafny to stop generating executable output and return a failure exit code, when warnings occur in the program. Contrary to the previous `--warn-as-error` option, warnings are always reported as warnings.
  - During development, users must use `dafny run --succeed-on-warnings` if they want to run their Dafny code when it contains warnings.
  - If users have builds that were passing with warnings, they have to add `--succeed-on-warnings` to allow them to still pass. 
  - If users upgrade to a new Dafny version, and are not using `--succeed-on-warnings`, and do not want to migrate off of deprecated features, they will have to use `--allow-deprecation`. 
- A doo file that was created using `--succeed-on-warnings` causes a warning if used by a consumer that does not use it.
