When translated to other languages, Dafny module names no longer have the suffix `_Compile` appended to them. This may cause issues with existing code from non-Dafny languages in your codebase, if that code was previously referencing modules with `_Compile` in the name. You can migrate either by removing the `_Compile` part of references in your codebase, or by using the backwards compatibility option `--compile-suffix` when using `translate`, `build`, or `run`.
