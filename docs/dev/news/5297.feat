- To enable smoothly working with multiple projects inside a single repository, Dafny now allows using a Dafny project file as an argument to `--library`. This does the following: if the given Dafny project's output folder does not contain a doo file whose checksum matches the project's sources, then first a doo file is built. After that, this doo file is passed to `--library`. Attempting to use an existing doo file allows not doing verification twice for repositories where multiple local projects have the same local project as a dependency.
