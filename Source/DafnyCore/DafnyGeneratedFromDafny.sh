# Until we get proper dependency to previous Dafny, you have to generate the file GeneratedFromDafny.cs
# To remove this manual build process, when it will be appropriate:
# 1. Delete the file GeneratedFromDafny.cs
# 2. Add a dependcy to 
#      <PackageReference Include="dafny.msbuild" Version="1.0.0" />
# That's it! The same file will now be automatically generated as obj/Debug/net6.0/GeneratedFromDafny.cs
