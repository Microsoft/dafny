An export declaration consists of one or more `reveals`, `provides`, and extends clauses. Each clause contains

An [iterator](https://dafny.org/latest/DafnyRef/DafnyRef#sec-iterator-types) is like a co-routine: 
its control flow produces (yields) a value, but the execution continues from that point (a yield statement) to go on to produce the next value, rather than exiting the method. 
To accentuate this difference, a `yield` statement is used to say when the next value of the iterator is ready, rather than a `return` statement.
In addition, the declaration does not use `returns` to state the out-parameter, as a method would. Rather it has a `yields` clause.
The example above is a valid example if `returns` is replaced by `yields`.

Constructors are used to initalize the state of an instance of a class.
